  <h5>part two responses: </h5>

    <li>Deconstructing apps by hierarchy, content, intent, and audience can aid in observing underlooked details of a product (including websites). Both the examples in the article and the apps on my phone show how design differs depending on the user’s goal. </li>
    <li>I found the sections “Hierarchy” and “Intent” the most interesting; both featured questions that made me rethink the design of some apps/websites, like what problem a product is designed to solve and how that impacts aesthetics. </li>
    <li>"How does the design guide your focus?"</li>
    <li>7/10 (I liked the GIFs)</li>
  </ul>
