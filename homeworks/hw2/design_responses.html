						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The significance of white space in visual organization isn’t something I thought about previously, so it was interesting to learn about. 
								Padding can create visual focus without a cluttered UI, bringing clarity to the content of the site. 
								Also, utilizing rules like having every design element a multiple of 8 pixels furthers consistency to the site experience. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I especially liked the section about visual organization and them connecting the significance of clearly defining different parts of a site to the Gestalt Principle of Proximity.
								 Without whitespace, different sections of a part may appear as serving a singular purpose, rather than the intended relationship between sections. 
								 The example they showed of the Wayfair site shows how even a slight difference in spacing can improve readability!  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Everyone has heard the saying “less is more”. This applies to content on any given page, where less visual noise makes for a better user experience" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
