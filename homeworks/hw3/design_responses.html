						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Since I didn’t know much about typography, most of this was new information for me, especially aligning the typography of a site to the intended audience and purpose. 
								It’s interesting how font changes depending on the audience’s needs and the information we wish to convey, and how this impacts our overall style guide. 
								The numerous resources for exploring and identifying fonts goes to show how significant it is in how a site is perceived.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought the section on pairing fonts was really interesting! 
								It’s something I don’t really think about when exploring sites, usually assuming they’re all the same font, but the slight differences in thickness can make a large impact. 
								Also, using the Golden Ratio or the Perfect Fourth to determine pleasing ratios between font size is cool and shows how math and art can intersect!  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
