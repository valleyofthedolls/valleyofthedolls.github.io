					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The focus of the article was on accessibility, specifically how adjusting contrast and color in digital product design can aid those with differing visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive abilities for a more inclusive web. 
								Although I was familiar with the idea of accessibility on the web, I learned a lot about the specific tools used to do so, like Colorable and Colorsafe to adjust hue, saturation, and brightness to see its effect on accessibility of a specific color combination.
								The process of creating and documenting accessible color systems wasn’t something I was familiar with, especially some of the tools available to assist and public guidelines like WCAG 2.1.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Looking through some of the tools mentioned was really interesting! 
								For example, using tools like Colorable or Colorsafe to meet W3C’s background-to-text contrast ratio or InVision Craft to create and share a color system among a team.
								 Web accessibility, or even something like “dark mode”, is something I was vaguely aware or and benefitting from (like most web users), it’s interesting to deep dive into the process of doing so.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “…not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude”  </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
